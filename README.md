# flag-book-designer
This is a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketch for visually designing mock-ups of flag books, including calculating dimensions and creating a printable template. A flag book is a structure developed by Heidi Kyle; more information and examples can be found here http://www.philobiblon.com/flagbook/

This sketch will help with figuring out the proportions to use when designing flag books. By automating all the math and utilizing a slider to change dimensions, the user is able to visually compare the various size options quickly, speeding up the mock-up process. This sketch will grow in functionality as I continue to experiment with making flag books and decide what other features would be useful.

More functionality to come:
* Add toggle for metric units
* Add ability to size individual flags
* Add arrows to signal direction a row of flags faces (?)
* Add ability to change the in-browser scale
* Fix scale for printing templates
