# flag-book-designer
p5.js sketch for visually designing mock-ups of flag books, including calculating measurements and creating a printable template.

This sketch will help me with figuring out the proportions to use when designing flag books. By automating all the math and utilizing a slider to change dimensions, I am able to visually compare the various size options quickly, speeding up the mock-up process. This sketch will grow in functionality as I experiment with making flag books and decide what other tools would be useful.

More functionality to come:
Add metric units.
Add ability to size individual flags.
Add arrows to signal direction a row of flags faces (?)
